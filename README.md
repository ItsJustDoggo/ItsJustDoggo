Hello, I'm ItsJustDoggo
- Pronouns: Doesn't matter to me, but you can default to he/him.
- Hobbies: Art, gaming and coding.
- Goals: Learn to code and improve those coding skills as much as possible.
I created a github account to possibly create some connections with other coders.
I've heard that connections are good and having other people to ponder problems with must be helpful!
